## Context and Problem Statement

How do we collect data that allows for pre-built tools to create, read, update, delete (CRUD) with little to no configuration?

The nature of IMT assignments require numerous pre-built tools to enable personnel to begin performing CRUD operations immediately. Additionally, pre-built tools for specific functions/tasks necessitates a pre-defined schema to perform operations on.

This ADR attempts to layout the underlying data schema.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

1. Standardized data schema acting as a framework for all assignments.
2. Different data schemas for different assignment types.
3. Creation of schema at time of incident assignment.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Framework schema due to flexibility, ability to pre-develop/deploy tools, and drastic reduction of resources required to deploy.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Enable immediate data collection following notification of assignment. 
* Framework allows creating domains to limit feature types based on assignment requirements (requires completion of [#14](https://github.com/fdny-imt/IMT-GIS-Tools/issues/14) to be completed).
* In conjunction with ready-state deployment, will require no work from technical specialists to begin collection (technical specialist will be required for above point).
* Allows for pre-developed and deployed tools (surveys, webapps, etc.) to be ready for immediate use.
* Common schema allows for simple archiving by appending to a master feature service.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Will require numerous SQL queries on downstream products to ensure viewing of relevant data (consider use of feature service views to perform the queries and serve as layers).
* Will require a technical specialist to update domains. See [#14](https://github.com/fdny-imt/IMT-GIS-Tools/issues/14).
* May require unknown sacrifices on what data can be collected or methods in which it can be collected.
## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Framework Schema

Create frame work that contains can accept numerous pre-loaded feature types and provide the ability to update domains from a template. ([#14](https://github.com/fdny-imt/IMT-GIS-Tools/issues/14)).

* Pros:
  * Allows for same schema for all potential incident types
  * Allows for hasty deployment for immediate use
  * Allows for starting from standalone database for disconnected incidents
  * Allows for pre-developed/deployed tools

* Cons:
  * May require technical specialist to update domains
  * Potential to limit the data that can be collected and the methods of collection.

### Incident-Type Specific Schemas

Create numerous pre-defined schemas for pre-determined incident types.

* Pros:
  * More specific schemas specific to certain incident types
  * Would not require updating of domains for feature types

* Cons:
  * Limited to pre-determined incident types. Incidents outside those previously built require falling back to option 3 (manual creation)
  * If data to be collected falls outside the pre-determined feature types would require updating of domains/fields
  * Severely limits ability to maintain pre-deployed tools
  * Requires maintaining multiple schemas/deployments

**Note:** Some of the cons may be able to be negated by scripting but largely remain significant hurdles. 

### Custom Schema Per Incident

Manual creation of database at time of assignment.

* Pros:
  * Custom schema provides results most likely to meet needs of incident

* Cons:
  * Requires extensive time and technical knowledge to create
  * Can be very difficult to change mid-incident, potentially resulting in data loss
  * No ability to create/deploy pre-developed tools
  * Has ability to create very difficult to understand/maintain data structures

# Low-level 

**Discussion**:

 - **Subtypes vs. Contingent Values:**
   - At first glance, subtypes provide the required functionality however, they fall short in one critical area. Subtypes must be symbolized on the subtype field. That would result in all HazMat lines being symbolized the same as opposed to by feature type (ie. Warm Zone). This is a documented limitation ([see here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/insights/latest/get-started/domains-and-subtypes.htm)). Contingent values offer very similar functionality without the subtype symbology limitation.

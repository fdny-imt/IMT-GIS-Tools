    "text": "All-hazard incident management teams (AHIMTs) are often tasked with responding to and managing incidents of wildly varying scope and complexity. The role of AHIMTs continues to evolve into a more data centric role due to legal issues, incident complexity, and interoperability requirements. These challenges necessitate a flexible framework for managing geospatial data during incidents. Unlike the wildland firefighting community, no standards currently exist specific to geospatial data management for AHIMTs. With this project, we aim to provide a framework for handling geospatial data for AHIMTs and the necessary tools for managing said framework.\nTo that end, we propose the following solution:\n\nStandardized event geodatabase (EGDB) schema.\n\n[Future] PostGIS schema matching EGDB\n\nPre-built web-apps, map layouts, and analysis tools that match schema.\nTools to allow adapting framework to mission requirements with minimal training.\nStandard operating procedures (SOP) that defines operational procedures for handling geospatial data and associated products.\n\nThe above will allow teams to quickly establish methods for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing data while providing the flexibility required to adapt to changing situations."
